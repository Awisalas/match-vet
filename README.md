# MatchVet

MatchVet is a zero-cost, local-first football research and betting-preference vetting engine. The initial product runs in Termux and remains in RESEARCH_ONLY mode until its Selection Policy earns Production Promotion.

T01 provides the installable command-line baseline only. It does not create a database, ingest football data, or make recommendations.

## Bootstrap

Use the pinned native Termux packages and Python environment described in [the Termux environment guide](docs/termux-environment.md). Then run:

    scripts/bootstrap-termux.sh
    .venv/bin/matchvet
    .venv/bin/matchvet doctor

## Checks

    ruff check .
    ruff format --check .
    .venv/bin/mypy
    .venv/bin/pytest

The default test suite is deterministic and does not use the internet.
